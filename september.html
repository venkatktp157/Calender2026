            The Saint Nedelya Cathedral (Bulgarian: Катедрален храм "Св. великомъченица Неделя" в София or църква „Света Неделя“,<br>
            romanized: Sveta Nedelya), is an Eastern Orthodox cathedral in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, a cathedral of the Sofia bishopric<br>
            of the Bulgarian Patriarchate. The temple of Sveta Nedelya dates from the 10th century, being a cathedral of the city from the<br> 
            18th century. The sacred building suffered destruction through the ages and was reconstructed many times.<br>
            The present building of the temple is among the landmarks of Sofia.<br>
            It was designed by the famous Bulgarian architectural team Vasilyov-Tsolov.<br>
            The relics of the Serbian king Stefan Uroš II Milutin are kept in the church.<br>
            The St Nedelya Church bombing was a terrorist attack on St Nedelya Church in Sofia, Bulgaria.<br>
            It was carried out on 16 April 1925, when a group of the Military Organisation of the Bulgarian Communist Party directed and<br>
            supplied by the Soviet Military Intelligence blew up the church's roof during the funeral service of General Konstantin Georgiev,<br>
            who had been killed in a previous communist assault on 14 April.<br>
            Over 200 people, mainly from the country's political and military elite, were killed in the attack and around 500 bystander<br>
            worshipers, who attended the liturgy, were injured.<br>
            The bombing is by far the deadliest terrorist act in Bulgarian history and the deadliest in all of Europe until the<br> 
            Air India Flight 182 in 1985 60 years later.
