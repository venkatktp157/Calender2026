            The Church of the Holy Mother of God, full name Cathedral Church of the Dormition of the Holy Mother of God<br>
            (Bulgarian: Църква Света Богородица, Катедрален храм "Успение Богородично") is a Bulgarian National Revival church in<br>
            Bulgaria's second largest city Plovdiv.<br>
            The church is situated in the Old town of Plovdiv on one of the city's seven hills, Nebet Tepe.<br>
            A small church existed on the site as early as the 9th century. The church was renovated in 1186 by the bishop of Plovdiv<br>
            Constantine Pantehi and it became part of a monastery. Both the church and the monastery were destroyed when the Ottoman<br>
            Turks conquered the city in 1371 in the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars.<br>
            The current edifice was constructed in 1844 as the main church of the city. It was a large three-nave pseudo-basilica built by<br>
            craftsmen from Bratsigovo, and the first benefactors (ktitors) were wealthy merchants from the town of Koprivshtitsa,<br>
            the Chalukov brothers - Vulko and Stoyan Teodorovich Chalukovi. The iconostasis was made by carvers from Bulgarian School<br>
            of Debar. Most of the church's icons were created by the painter Nikola of Odrin.
