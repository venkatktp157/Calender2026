            The Church of St Petka of the Saddlers (Bulgarian: Църква „Света Петка Самарджийска“) is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox <br>
            church in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. The church is located in a semi-submerged shopping mall, and can be accessed via the<br>
            Serdika metro station.<br>
            The church was first mentioned in the 16th century and was constructed at the place of a former Roman religious building.<br>
            It is today a monument of culture known for its mural paintings from the 14th, 15th, 17th and 19th century depicting biblical<br>
            scenes.<br>
            The church is dedicated to St Petka, an 11th-century Bulgarian saint.<br>
            The Church of Saint Petka acquired its present name due to it being a patron of the saddlers in the Middle Ages, who <br>
            performed their rituals in the church. The adjective samardzhiyski ("of the saddlers") was derived from the Ottoman Turkish <br>
            word semerci, meaning "saddlemaker".

            The Sofia Synagogue (Bulgarian: Софийска синагога, Sofiyska sinagoga) is a Romaniote Orthodox Jewish congregation<br>
            and synagogue, located in Sofia, Bulgaria. Completed in 1909, the synagogue is the largest synagogue in Southeastern Europe,<br>
            the third-largest in Europe, and one of two active synagogues remaining in Bulgaria.<br>
            Despite the building's size, the services are normally only attended by some 50 to 60 worshippers due to the aliyah of most of <br>
            Bulgaria's Jews to Israel and the secularity of the local Jewish population.

      <h2>Banya Bashi Mosque, Sofia</h2>

            Banya Bashi Mosque (Bulgarian: Баня баши джамия, Banya bashi dzhamiya; Turkish: Banya Başı Camii) is a Sunni Islamic <br>
            mosque in Sofia, Bulgaria.<br>
            The mosque was designed by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan and completed in 1566, during the years the<br>
            Ottomans had control of the city. The mosque derives its name from the phrase Banya Bashi, which means many baths.<br>
            In the Turkish language Banyo means bath and Baş (pronounced Bash) means 'head' or 'main', so looking at the location it is<br>
            built on, a more logical translation of the name would be 'Head of the bath mosque'. The most outstanding feature of the<br>
            mosque is that it was actually built over natural thermal spas; one can even see the steam rising from vents in the ground near<br>
            the mosque walls. The mosque is famous for its large 15 m-diameter (49 ft) dome, and the minaret.<br>
            Currently, the Banya Bashi Mosque is the only functioning mosque in Sofia, a remnant of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria that<br>
            lasted nearly five centuries, and is used by the city's Muslim community.<br>
            On 21 May 2011, the mosque was stage of the Banya Bashi Mosque clashes between the Muslims and the Far-right party Ataka.
