            The Church of Saint George (Bulgarian: Ротонда „Свети Георги“, romanized: Rotonda "Sveti Georgi") is a late antique red brick <br>
            rotunda in Sofia, Bulgaria. Built in the early 4th century CE as Roman baths, it became a church inside the walls of Serdica,<br>
            capital of ancient Dacia Mediterranea during the Roman and Byzantine eras. The early Christian church is considered the oldest <br>
            building in modern Sofia and belongs to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.<br>
            The building, a cylindrical domed structure built on a square base, is famous for the 12th-, 13th-, and 14th-century frescoes<br>
            inside the central dome. Three layers of frescoes have been discovered, the earliest dating from the 10th century. <br>
            Frescoes of 22 prophets over two meters (six point six feet) tall crown the dome.<br>
            Painted over during the Ottoman era, when the building was used as a mosque, these frescoes were only uncovered and <br>
            restored in the 20th century.
