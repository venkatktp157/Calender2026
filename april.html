            The National Assembly Building is used by the Bulgarian parliament for parliamentary debates.<br>
            The main building has been proclaimed a monument of culture for its historic significance.<br>
            Situated in downtown Sofia, it was designed in Neo-Renaissance style by Konstantin Jovanović, a Serbian-Bulgarian architect <br>
            who received his education in Vienna and Switzerland and whose other works include the Parliament of Serbia building.<br>
            It was constructed between 1884 and 1886 by Friederich Wilhelm Gustav Liebe, a young builder from Saxony who was 22 years <br>
            old when construction began.<br>
            The building was originally painted in an off-white hue, but since the latter part of the 20th century has been white.<br>
            The building is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 20 leva banknote, issued in 1999 and 2007.<br>
            Due to insufficient space in the main building at Parliament Square, some administrative offices of the National Assembly are <br>
            now housed in the former headquarters (Партийния дом, Partiyniya dom, "the Party House") of the Bulgarian Communist Party, <br>
            located at the Largo.
