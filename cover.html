            Saint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia (Bulgarian: Храм-паметник "Свети Александър Невски", Romanized: Hram-pametnik "Sveti Aleksandar Nevski") is a Bulgarian Orthodox cathedral in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.<br>
            Built in the Neo-Byzantine style, it serves as the cathedral church of the Patriarch of Bulgaria and it is one of the largest Christian church buildings by volume in the world. It is one of Sofia's symbols and primary tourist attractions.<br>
            St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia occupies an area of 3,170 square meters (34,100 sq ft) and can hold 5,000 worshipers. It is among the ten largest Eastern Orthodox church buildings.<br>
            It is the largest cathedral in the Balkans. It is believed that up until the year 2000 it was the largest finished Orthodox cathedral.<br>
            The construction of the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral started in 1882 (having been planned since 19 February 1879), when the foundation stone was laid, but most of it was built between 1904 and 1912.<br>
            Saint Alexander Nevsky was a Russian prince. The cathedral was created in honor of the Russian soldiers who died during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, as a result of which Bulgaria was liberated from Ottoman rule.

            The Statue of Sofia (Bulgarian: Статуя на София, romanized: Statuya na Sofiya) is a monumental sculpture in Sofia, Bulgaria.<br>
            It was officially opened to the public by the capital's mayor Stefan Sofiyanski on December 28, 2000.<br>
            The Statue of Sofia was approved by the Sofia City Council on September 17, 2000, known as the Day of Sofia in Bulgaria.<br>
            The Bulgarian Orthodox Church honors the martyr Sophia of Rome on this date.<br>
            The statue was intended as a symbol for better times in the new millennium, and was erected in two days from <br>
            December 25–27, 2000 in a spot once occupied by a statue of Lenin.<br>
            The Statue of Sofia is named after the capital of Bulgaria, which in turn is named after the Saint Sophia Church.<br> 
            Likewise, the statue was planned to be named Saint Sophia, although the Orthodox Church considered it too pagan to be associated with Sophia of Rome.
