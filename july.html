            The Monument of the Unknown Soldier in Sofia is a focus of official and tourist activities – visiting dignitaries lay flowers at the<br>
            Eternal Flame, and children climb a larger-than-life yet weary lion of bronze, while visitors take selfies with it.<br>
            The lion, arguably the most beautiful in Sofia's pack, was designed by sculptor Andrey Nikolov in the 1930s, as a symbol of the<br>
            youth and strength of Bulgaria.<br>
            The monument and the lion were unveiled in 1941, after years of debate and procrastination.<br>
            After the Communists took over, they decided the statue was too fascist.<br>
            The beautiful lion was dismantled and moved around Sofia until it ended up in the National Military Museum.<br>
            In 1981, however, the Monument of the Unknown Soldier went to a complete reconstruction, and the lion was brought back to<br>
            its original place.
