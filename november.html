      <h2>Piece of Berlin Wall, Sofia</h2>

            Do you know that most citizens in Sofia don't know about the existence of a real piece of the Berlin Wall in Sofia?<br>
            It is situated right in the center, in the park of the National Palace of Culture, also known as NDK in Bulgarian.<br>
            After the end of World War II, the concrete barrier of the Berlin Wall not only divided Berlin and Germany but also physically<br>
            and ideologically separated the East from the West.<br>
            It served as a symbol of division, and its demolition began in 1989.
            Pieces of the Berlin Wall can be found all around the world, and you can even locate some on eBay.<br>
            The piece in Sofia was donated by citizens of Berlin in 2006 as a symbol of peace and unity.<br>
            To find it within the park, face the main entrance of NDK, then turn left and head toward Fritjof Nansen Street<br>
            (and Vassil Levski Boulevard). Right before the end of the park where you cross the street, look to your left, and you'll find the<br>
            monument! Keep in mind that it is often a target of vandalism, and it is not uncommon to see new graffiti on it from<br>
            time to time.
