            The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (abbreviated BAS; Bulgarian: Българска академия на науките, Bŭlgarska akademiya na <br>
            naukite, abbreviated БАН) is the National Academy of Bulgaria, established in 1869.<br>
            The Academy, with headquarters in Sofia, is autonomous and consists of a Society of Academicians, Correspondent Members <br>
            and Foreign Members. It publishes and circulates different scientific works, encyclopaedias, dictionaries and journals, and runs <br>
            its own publishing house.<br>
            The activities are distributed in three main branches: Natural, mathematical and engineering sciences; Biological, medical and agrarian sciences 
            and Social sciences, humanities and art.<br>
            They are structured in 42 independent scientific institutes, and a dozen of laboratories and other sections.<br>
            Julian Revalski has been the president of the BAS since 2016. As of 2022, its budget was 119,860 million leva (€61.28 million).
